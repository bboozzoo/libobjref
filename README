* TODO:
  - memory posioning on free
  - trace caller on allocation
  - handling of incorrect refcounts (ex. unref of obj with refcnt == 0)

* USAGE:
  Basic assumptions:
  - newly allocated object has reference count of 1
  - reference count 0 indicates an unused object which will be freed

  Allocate a new object by calling objref_alloc with objects's size,
  identically to malloc. The destructor function will be called when
  the reference count drops to 0. The destructor function gets a
  pointer to the object.
  References are obtained with objref and released with objunref.
